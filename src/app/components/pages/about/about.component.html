<h3>
    About JavaScript
</h3>
<p>
    often abbreviated as "JS", is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted run-time language.[7] It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification.[8] Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World
    Wide Web content production; the majority of websites employ it, and all modern Web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins.[7] JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented,[9]
    imperative, and functional programming styles.[7] It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions, but does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment
    in which it is embedded.[8] Although there are strong outward similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two are distinct languages and differ greatly in their design. JavaScript
    was influenced by programming languages such as Self and Scheme.[10] JavaScript is also used in environments that are not Web-based, such as PDF documents, site-specific browsers, and desktop widgets. Newer and faster JavaScript virtual machines (VMs)
    and platforms built upon them have also increased the popularity of JavaScript for server-side Web applications. On the client side, developers have traditionally implemented JavaScript as an interpreted language, but more recent browsers perform
    just-in-time compilation. Programmers also use JavaScript in video-game development, in crafting desktop and mobile applications, and in server-side network programming with run-time environments such as Node.js.
